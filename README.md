# JAVA Break Out Game Applet

## Introduction
An interesting implementation of the classic Break Out game in Java.  The new idea is the paddle moving in the X and Y
coordinates.

## How to build
Have provided the Eclipse Luna Project.  Can use it to build an applet to run or run the applet within Eclipse.

## Future
* Game restart.  Was there, but the dog ate the code for it.  Just kidding, but a problem with the hard drive did wreck
that version of the code.  Won't hapen again since it is under git on a server.
* Network the game for up to 4 players, each player having his/her own paddle.
